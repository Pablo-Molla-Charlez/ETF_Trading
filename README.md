# ETF Trading Strategies

Welcome to my repository of ETF Trading Strategies implemented in Python! 

Here, you will find a collection of algorithms and models I've developed to analyze and trade ETFs, with a focus on creating robust strategies for the ever-volatile market.

## About Me

I'm a Mathematician turned Data Science enthusiast, currently pursuing my Master's degree at Paris-Saclay. I have a deep-rooted interest in Forex, ETFs, and options trading.

When I'm not buried in numbers or daydreaming about algorithms, you can find me exploring the intricate world of trading, where every decision counts and every trade tells a story.

## Retirement Pension? Why Not!

They say the best time to start saving for retirement was yesterday, the second-best time is today. 
Well, I say, why save for retirement when you can code your way there? That's right, the goal here is not just to implement successful trading strategies but to craft my very own digital retirement pension.
Who needs a pension fund when you've got Python, am I right?
